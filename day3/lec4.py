# Leap year problem in python

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# for a number to be leap year it has 3 condtion and all are else-if form 4-100-400
# 1. year/4 yes-> leap year no-> not a leap year
# 2. if year/4 ->yes then two check year/100 yes-> leap year and check by 400 no->then also year year
# 3. if year/100 is yes then year/400 yes-> leap year no-> not a leap year

# if year%4==0:
#     if year%100==0:
